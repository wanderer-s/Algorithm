[Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array `in-place` with `O(1)` extra memory.

#### Example 1:
```js
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

#### Example 2:
```js
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10⁵`
- `s[i]` is a _printable ascii character_.
